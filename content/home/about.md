# Biography

Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia is an assistant professor at the [Department of
Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.usf.edu/engineering/cse/) at the
University of South Florida (USF). He is interested in all problems arising
from the interplay between people and computing systems, in particular the
integrity of information in cyberspace and the trustworthiness and reliability
of social computing systems. At USF, he leads the [Computational Sociodynamics
Laboratory](lab).

Prior to joining USF he was at Indiana University as an assistant research
scientist at the [Indiana University Network Science
Institute](http://iuni.iu.edu/) (IUNI), and before that as a postdoctoral fellow at the
[Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research](//cnets.indiana.edu), an
analyst for the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/), and a
research associate at the [Professorship of Computational Social
Science](http://www.coss.ethz.ch/) at the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](//ethz.ch)
in Zurich. His work has been covered in major news outlets, including the Wall
Street Journal, Wired, MIT Technology Review, NPR, and CBS News, to cite a few.
