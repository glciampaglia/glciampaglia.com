# Biography

Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia is an assistant professor at the [College of Information Studies](//ischool.umd.edu) at the [University of Maryland](//umd.edu). He is interested in problems originating from the interplay between people and computing systems, in the determinants of information quality in cyberspace, and in how information propagates across social networks, with application to the integrity of information in cyberspace and the trustworthiness and reliability of social computing systems. 

Prior to joining UMD he was an assistant professor at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](//cse.usf.edu) at the [University of South Florida](//usf.edu) (USF), where he led the [Computational Sociodynamics Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/usfcsdl).

Giovanni was the recipient in 2013 of a mobility fellowship from the [Swiss National Science Foundation](//snsf.ch) and received postdoctoral training at the [Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research](//cnets.indiana.edu) at [Indiana University Bloomington](//indiana.edu). He later joined the [Indiana University Network Science Institute](//iuni.iu.edu) as an assistant research scientist until 2018. Prior to his postdoc, he was an analyst for the [Wikimedia Foundation](//wikimediafoundation.org) and a research associate at the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](//coss.ethz.ch) in Zurich, Switzerland.

He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Lugano](//www.inf.usi.ch), Switzerland and a Laurea degree in Computer Science from [_Sapienza_ University of Rome](//www.di.uniroma1.it), Italy. His work has been covered in major news outlets, including the _Wall Street Journal_, _Wired_, _MIT Technology Review_, _NPR_, and _CBS News_, to cite a few.
