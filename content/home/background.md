I obtained my Ph.D. in [Informatics](http://www.inf.usi.ch) from
_Università della Svizzera Italiana_ (also known as University of Lugano)
in December 2011. My research was supervised jointly by Luca Maria
Gambardella ([IDSIA](http://www.idsia.ch/%7Eluca/)), Alberto Vancheri
(co-advisor,
[SUPSI](http://www.supsi.ch/dti/strumenti/rubrica/dettaglio.5503.backLink.58b96214-2453-483c-9f5f-d122ec981907.html))
and Paolo Giordano (co-advisor, [Uni
Wien](http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~giordap7/)).

Before joining CNetS, I was previously research analyst contractor at the
[Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/), working on [editor
engagement issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editor_engagement),
research associate at the [Chair of Computational Social
Science](http://www.coss.ethz.ch), in the [Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology](http://ethz.ch) (ETH) in Zürich, Switzerland, and SNSF postdoctoral
fellow at the [Center for Complex Networks and Systems
Research](http://cnets.indiana.edu/) (CNetS), [Indiana University
Bloomington](http://iub.edu), thanks to the generous support of the [Swiss
National Science Foundation](http://snf.ch).
