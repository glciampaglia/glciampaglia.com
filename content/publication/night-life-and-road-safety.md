abstract = """ The proliferation of cheap Internet-enabled sensors and services
is starting to shed light on aspects of human behavior that hitherto could not
have been studied in detail. In particular, the way in which mobility and
pro-social behaviors contribute to road safety has remained unexplored. In this
work we analyze data from a ride sharing service, Twitter, and accident reports
to analyze how mobility, safety mutually influence each other. Road traffic is
estimated based on the number of trips passing through a specific area and
correlated with the number of reported accidents. Geo-located Twitter activity
is also used to identify the popularity of different locations within the city
and how it correlated with lower safety records. Major behavioral and temporal
patterns are identified and analyzed for each city and differences between
cities are highlighted. These results highlight the role social media play as
sensors for collective phenomena and could help to better understand the social
factors involved in road safety. """
