abstract = """ The massive spread of fake news has been identified as a
major global risk and has been alleged to influence elections and threaten
democracies. Communication, cognitive, social, and computer scientists are
engaged in efforts to study the complex causes for the viral diffusion of
digital misinformation and to develop solutions, while search and social
media platforms are beginning to deploy countermeasures. However, to date,
these efforts have been mainly informed by anecdotal evidence rather than
systematic data. Here we analyze 14 million messages spreading 400 thousand
claims on Twitter during and following the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign
and election. We find evidence that social bots play a key role in the
spread of fake news. Accounts that actively spread misinformation are
significantly more likely to be bots. Automated accounts are particularly
active in the early spreading phases of viral claims, and tend to target
influential users. Humans are vulnerable to this manipulation, retweeting
bots who post false news. Successful sources of false and biased claims are
heavily supported by social bots. These results suggest that curbing social
bots may be an effective strategy for mitigating the spread of online
misinformation. """
