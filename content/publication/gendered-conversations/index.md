abstract = """ Online social media and games are increasingly replacing
offline social activities. Social media is now an indispensable mode of
communication; online gaming is not only a genuine social activity but also
a popular spectator sport. Although online interaction shrinks social and
geographical barriers, it is argued that social disparities, such as gender
inequality, persists. For instance, online gaming communities have been
criticized for objectifying women, which is a pressing question as gaming
evolves into a social platform. However, few large-scale, systematic
studies of gender inequality and objectification in social gaming platforms
exist. Here we analyze more than one billion chat messages from Twitch, a
social game-streaming platform, to study how the gender of streamers is
associated with the nature of conversation. We find that female streamers
receive significantly more objectifying comments while male streamers
receive more game- related comments. This difference is more pronounced for
popular streamers. We also show that the viewersâ€™ choice of channels is
also strongly gendered. Our findings suggest that gendered conversation and
objectification is prevalent, and most users produce strongly gendered
messages. """
