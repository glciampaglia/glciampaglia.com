abstract = """ Studies have demonstrated that social media may offer
insights into social behaviors. Here we investigate the potential of social
media in predicting criminal behavior, in particular rape and sexual abuse.
Traditional approaches for studying sexual violence are effective but
laborious, although often limited to small sample sizes and coarse temporal
resolutions. Additionally, the sensitive nature of sexual violence and
stigmas against victims result in serious under reporting of rape crime
statistics. The factors contributing to rape are not fully agreed upon, but
research shows that the acceptance of, and willingness to commit rape are
highly correlated with sex­role stereotyping, rape myth beliefs, and
misogyny. Here we explore whether social media can be used as an indicator
of sexual violence in the US, by tracking misogynistic tweets. We compared
the number of tweets and rape crime statistics for each state, and found a
significant association. Our work paves the way to the design of a ‘social
sensor’ system to detect rape and other abuse by monitoring social streams.
