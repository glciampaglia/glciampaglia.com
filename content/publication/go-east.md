abstract = """In this paper we present a model of urban growth and its
preliminary application to acase study of the phenomena of residential
development in the setting of the eastern periphery ofRome, Italyâ€™s capital
city. The modeling approach we use synthesises the two typical
paradigmswidespread in the community of quantitative urban planning: the
traditional one, based on cellularautomata (CA), and the (relatively) new one,
which is agent-based. In particular, our multi-agentsystem (MAS) is in-between a
reactive MAS, with agents carrying out a two-staged decision processin a complex
environment, and a model of statistical physics, since we use populations
ofagents in order to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the system.
While we explicitlymodel the consumption of agricultural and undeveloped land
due to urban growth, our modelmay be easily integrated as a socio-economic part
into a wider decision support system for environmentalplanning, e.g. our
simulations can produce indicators of environmental impact of thegrowth of the
city: electricity consumption, waste production, etc."""
