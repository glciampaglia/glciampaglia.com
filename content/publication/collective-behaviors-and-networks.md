about recent advances in the study of networks and their applications to the
study of collective behavior in socio-technical systems. The series includes
contributions exploring the intersection between data-driven studies of complex
networks and agent-based models of collective social behavior. Particular
attention is devoted to topics aimed at understanding social behavior through
the lens of data about technology-mediated communication. These include:
modeling social dynamics of attention and collaboration, characterizing online
group formation and evolution, and studying the emergence of roles and
interaction patterns in social media environments."""
