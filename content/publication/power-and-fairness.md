abstract = """Power is the ability to influence others towards the attainment of
specific goals, and it is a fundamental force that shapes behavior at all levels
of human existence. Several theories on the nature of power in social life
exist, especially in the context of social influence. Yet, in bargaining
situations, surprisingly little is known about its role in shaping social
preferences. Such preferences are considered to be the main explanation for
observed behavior in a wide range of experimental settings. In this work, we set
out to understand the role of bargaining power in the stylized environment of a
Generalized Ultimatum Game (GUG). We modify the payoff structure of the standard
Ultimatum Game (UG) to investigate three situations: two in which the power
balance is either against the proposer or against the responder, and a balanced
situation. We find that other-regarding preferences, as measured by the amount
of money donated by participants, do not change with the amount of power, but
power changes the offers and acceptance rates systematically. Notably, unusually
high acceptance rates for lower offers were observed. This finding suggests that
social preferences may be invariant to the balance of power and confirms that
the role of power on human behavior deserves more attention."""
