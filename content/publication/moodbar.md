abstract = """ Socialization in online communities allows existing members to
welcome and recruit newcomers, introduce them to community norms and practices,
and sustain their early participation. However, socializing newcomers does not
come for free: in large communities, socialization can result in a significant
workload for mentors and is hard to scale. In this study we present results from
an experiment that measured the effect of a lightweight socialization tool on
the activity and retention of newly registered users attempting to edit for the
first time Wikipedia. Wikipedia is struggling with the retention of newcomers
and our results indicate that a mechanism to elicit lightweight feedback and to
provide early mentoring to newcomers improves their chances of becoming
long-term contributors. """

This research was performed while at the [Wikimedia
Foundation](//wikimediafoundation.org). For more information of the initial
study, please see our blog post on the official Wikipedia blog titled
"[What MoodBar tells us about registered
editors](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/07/05/what-moodbar-tells-us-about-new-registered-editors/)".

The paper presented at CSCW'15 expands upon those findings and concludes
that lightweight socialization does have a positive effect on long-term
editor retention on Wikipedia.
