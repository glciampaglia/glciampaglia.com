abstract = """ Online traces of human activity offer novel opportunities to
study the dynamics of complex knowledge exchange networks, in particular how
emergent patterns of collective attention determine what new information is
generated and consumed. Can we measure the relationship between demand and
supply for new information about a topic? We propose a normalization method to
compare attention bursts statistics across topics with heterogeneous
distribution of attention. Through analysis of a massive dataset on traffic to
Wikipedia, we find that the production of new knowledge is associated to
significant shifts of collective attention, which we take as proxy for its
demand. This is consistent with a scenario in which allocation of attention
toward a topic stimulates the demand for information about it, and in turn the
supply of further novel information. However, attention spikes only for a
limited time span, during which new content has higher chances of receiving
traffic, compared to content created later or earlier on. Our attempt to
quantify demand and supply of information, and our finding about their temporal
ordering, may lead to the development of the fundamental laws of the attention
economy, and to a better understanding of social exchange of knowledge
information networks. """

caption = """(a), Time series of traffic. The grey lines represent the daily
traffic to articles that are linked from/to the article “2012 Summer Olympics,”
according to a recent snapshot of Wikipedia (see Methods). For visualization
purposes, only a random sample of 100 neighbors is shown. The focal page is
represented by the black solid line; red and gold lines represent the average
and median traffic, respectively. The vertical black segments represent the
times when new linked articles are created (see Methods). (b), Network of
neighbors of “2012 Summer Olympics.” White nodes represent the neighbor articles
predating 2012; colored nodes correspond to neighbors created in 2012. The size
of the nodes is proportional to their yearly traffic volume; their position was
computed using the ARF layout32. (c and d), Same visualizations as (a) and (b)
for the entry about Hurricane Sandy and its neighbors. New articles tend to be
peripheral to these networks."""
