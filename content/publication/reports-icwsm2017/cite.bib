  Abstract                 = {The Workshop Program of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence’s International Conference on Web and Social Media (AAAI-17) was held in Montréal, Québec, Canada on Tuesday, May 15, 2017. There were eight workshops in the program: Digital Misinformation, Events Analytics Using Social Media Data, News and Public Opinion, Observational Studies through Social Media, Perceptual Biases and Social Media, Social Media and Demographic Research, Studying User Perceptions and Experiences with Algorithms, The ICWSM Science Slam. Workshops were held on the first day of the conference. Workshop participants met and discussed issues with a selected focus — providing an informal setting for active exchange among researchers, developers, and users on topics of current interest. Organizers from two of the workshop chose to include papers in the AAAI Technical Reports series (Observational Studies through Social Media and News and Public Opinion). Their papers were included as a nonarchival part of the ICWSM proceedings. Organizers from four of the workshops (Digital Misinformation, News and Public Opinion, Perceptual Biases and Social Media, and Studying User Perceptions and Experiences with Algorithms) submitted reports, which are reproduced in this report. Brief summaries of the other four workshops have been reproduced from their website descriptions.},
