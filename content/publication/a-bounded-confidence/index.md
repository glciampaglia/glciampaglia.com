abstract = """Commons-based peer production does seem to rest upon a paradox.
Although users produce all contents, at the same time participation is commonly
on a voluntary basis, and largely incentivized by achievement of project's
goals. This means that users have to coordinate their actions and goals, in
order to keep themselves from leaving. While this situation is easily
explainable for small groups of highly committed, like-minded individuals,
little is known about large-scale, heterogeneous projects, such as Wikipedia."""
