abstract = """Traditional fact checking by expert journalists cannot keep up
with the enormous volume of information that is now generated online.
Computational fact checking may significantly enhance our ability to evaluate
the veracity of dubious information. Here we show that the complexities of human
fact checking can be approximated quite well by finding the shortest path
between concept nodes under properly defined semantic proximity metrics on
knowledge graphs. Framed as a network problem this approach is feasible with
efficient computational techniques. We evaluate this approach by examining tens
of thousands of claims related to history, entertainment, geography, and
biographical information using a public knowledge graph extracted from
Wikipedia. Statements independently known to be true consistently receive higher
support via our method than do false ones. These findings represent a
significant step toward scalable computational fact-checking methods that may
one day mitigate the spread of harmful misinformation."""
