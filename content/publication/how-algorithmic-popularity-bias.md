abstract = """ Algorithms that favor popular items are used to help us
select among many choices, from engaging articles on a social media news
feed to songs and books that others have purchased, and from top-raked
search engine results to highly-cited scientific papers. The goal of these
algorithms is to identify high-quality items such as reliable news,
beautiful movies, prestigious information sources, and important
discoveries --- in short, high-quality content should rank at the top.
Prior work has shown that choosing what is popular may amplify random
fluctuations and ultimately lead to sub-optimal rankings. Nonetheless, it
is often assumed that recommending what is popular will help high-quality
content "bubble up" in practice. Here we identify the conditions in which
popularity may be a viable proxy for quality content by studying a simple
model of cultural market endowed with an intrinsic notion of quality. A
parameter representing the cognitive cost of exploration controls the
critical trade-off between quality and popularity. We find a regime of
intermediate exploration cost where an optimal balance exists, such that
choosing what is popular actually promotes high-quality items to the top.
Outside of these limits, however, popularity bias is more likely to hinder
quality. These findings clarify the effects of algorithmic popularity bias
on quality outcomes, and may inform the design of more principled
mechanisms for techno-social cultural markets. """
