## Description

Every day thousands of new entries are added to Wikipedia. While many contain
useful information, a large fraction is about content that does not meet
Wikipedia's inclusion standards. Examples include spam, copyrighted content,
and vandalism. However, since the encyclopedia tries to cover the sum of all
human knowledge, often it is hard to decide whether the content at hand should
be deleted or not. In this cases, Wikipedia editors and contributors try to
reach a consensus by discussing on a special board called _Articles for
Deletion_, or AfD. These discussions represent a sophisticate form of
crowdsourcing which, for its own nature, may be subject to a number of
socio-cognitive biases.

In this project we explored the shape of the most enduring AfD conversations.
We looked at two types of conversations: those in which the final consensus was
to delete (above), and those in which it was to keep. 

The project was released in celebration of the tenth anniversary from
Wikipedia's creation. In 2012 it received the _Kantar Information is
Beautiful Awards_  for [best interactive
visualization](//www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/443-notabilia).
The awarding jury included -- among others -- MoMA curator Paola
Antonelli and Brian Eno.
