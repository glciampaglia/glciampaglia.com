## Description

Most American adults access the news through social media[^1]. Massive amounts
of low-credibility content have spread over social media before and after the
2016 US Presidential Elections despite intense fact-checking efforts. How do
the spread of misinformation and fact-checking compete? What is the impact of
social bots in the spread of low-credibility content? To explore these
questions we built Hoaxy, a tool that visualizes the spread and competition of
digital misinformation and fact-checking on Twitter. Hoaxy is an open platform
that enables large-scale, systematic studies of how misinformation and
fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter. Hoaxy captures public tweets that
include links to articles from low-credibility and fact-checking sources.
In follow up work, through integration with Botometer, a state-of-the-art
social bot detection tool, Hoaxy is now capable of visualizing the impact of
social bots on public Twitter conversations.

Hoaxy is part of the suite of tools of the [Observatory on Social Media <sup><i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></sup>](//osome.iuni.iu.edu/) (OSoMe).
