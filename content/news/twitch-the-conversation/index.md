I wrote a short essay on the topic of [online sexism and algorithmic moderation](https://theconversation.com/can-online-gaming-ditch-its-sexist-ways-74493) for [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/) today. The essay brings together two topics of my research on online communities. The main topic of the article is a joint work with [Supun Nakandala](https://scnakandala.github.io/), [Yong-Yeol Ahn](http://yongyeol.com/), and [Norman Makoto Su](http://www.normsu.com/), which was presented at [ICWSM 2017](http://icwsm.org/2017/program/accepted-papers/) earlier this year. More information about the article can be found [here](/publication/gendered-conversations/). 

From our analysis of 

as well as an earlier joint work with [Dario Taraborelli](http://nitens.org).
